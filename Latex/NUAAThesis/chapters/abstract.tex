    如何在股票市场上获取超额收益一直是投资者们关心的问题，由此衍生了许多分析预测和选股理论，
    如最开始的基本面分析和技术分析：前者认为可以通过确定股票的内在价值来预测股价；后者根据
    股票的历史K线数据来预测股价。最近10年来，量化多因子模型快速发展：寻找和股票收益率最相
    关的因素，来刻画股票并进行选择。不同于这些方法，本文采取量化K线的方法，对K线数据筛选后
    利用机器学习方法进行预测。

    本文针对A股市场所有股票，分别在日线和周线两个周期上选取两种特定的数据形态组合，选择合适
    的特征，再利用支持向量机对未来多个交易周期的股票最低价平均值进行预测，并给出投资建议。本
    文的主要内容如下：第一章介绍了研究背景及研究意义，介绍了有关股票预测的国内外研究现状；第
    二章介绍了统计学习理论和支持向量机的理论基础；第三章详细介绍了模型的实现过程，包括选取指
    标，标准化数据，选取核函数以及各种超参数寻优方法的说明，给出了评估实验效果的评价指标；第
    四章呈现了本文的实验结果，并对得到的结果数据进行了分析和总结，从中找到数据的价值，最后给
    出相应的投资决策建议；第五章是对本文工作的总结，对实验的不足进行了分析，以及对未来的展望。

    本文经过严谨的实验研究后发现，支持向量机回归模型对特定数据形态组合的股票有不错的预测效果，
    不仅体现在日线的短期预测上，其对中长期的周线数据（如$T=15\text{周}$）也有预期之外的效
    果。最后分别根据一些特定情况的预测结果给出投资建议，以期获得超额收益。

    How to make excess gains in the stock market has always been a concern 
    for investors, many prediction and stock-picking theories have been 
    derived from this, such as the fundamental analysis and technical 
    analysis: the former holds that the stock price can be predicted by 
    determining the intrinsic value of the stock; the latter based on 
    historical K-line data of the stock. Quantitative multi-factor models 
    have evolved rapidly in the last decade: finding the factors most 
    relevant to stock yields to carve out stocks and make choices. Unlike 
    these approaches, this paper takes a quantitative K-line method 
    and uses machine learning methods to make predictions after screening 
    the K-line data.

    In this article, two specific combinations of data patterns are selected 
    for all the A-share market stocks in both daily and weekly cycles, the 
    appropriate characteristics are selected, and then the support vector 
    machine is used to predict the average of the stock lows over the next 
    several trading cycles, and investment advice is given. The main contents 
    of this paper are as follows: Chapter 1 introduces the research background 
    and research significance, and introduces the current state of domestic and 
    international research on stock prediction; Chapter 2 introduces the 
    statistical learning theory and the theoretical basis of the support 
    vector machine; Chapter 3 introduces the model implementation process in 
    detail, including the selection of indicators, standardized data, the 
    selection of kernel functions and the description of various hyperparameter 
    optimization methods, and gives the evaluation indicators to evaluate the 
    experimental effect; Chapter 4 presents the experimental results of this 
    paper, and analyzes and summarizes the resulting data to find the value of 
    the data, and finally gives the corresponding investment decision recommendations; 
    Chapter 5 summarizes the work of this paper, analyzes the shortcomings of 
    the experiment, and the future prospects.

    After rigorous experimental research, this paper finds that the support 
    vector machine regression model has good predictive effect on stocks 
    with a particular combination of data patterns, not only on the short 
    term prediction of the daily line, but also on the medium and long 
    term weekly data (e.g. T=15 weeks), which has the expected effect. 
    Finally, investment advice is given based on the projected results of 
    each of specific scenarios, with a view to achieving excess returns.
